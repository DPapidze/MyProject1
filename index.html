<h1> What is HTML? </h1>
<p>  The HyperText Markup Language or HTMLis the standard markup Language <br> for documents designed to be displayed in a web
    browser. It defines the <br> meaning and struqture of web content. It is often assisted by technologies <br> such as Cascading
    Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. <br> Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server
    of from local storage <br> and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <br> web page
    semantically and originally included cues for its appearance. <hr>
<h1> What is CSS? </h1>
<p>  cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation <br> of a document written in
    a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). <br> CSS is a cornerstone
    technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. <br> CSS is designed to enable the separation of content
    and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. <br> This separation can improve content accessibility; provide
    more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation <br> characteristics; enable multiple web pages to
    share formatting by specifyng the relevant CSS in a separate. CSS file, <br> which reduces complexity and repetition in
    the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load <br> speed between the pages that
    share the file and its formatting. <hr>
